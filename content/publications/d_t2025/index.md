Too many defective compute chips are escaping today’s manufacturing
tests – at least an order of magnitude more than industrial targets
across all compute chip types in data centers. Silent data corruptions
(SDCs) caused by test escapes, when left unaddressed, pose a major
threat to reliable computing. We present a three-pronged approach
outlining future directions for overcoming test escapes: (a) Quick
diagnosis of defective chips directly from system-level incorrect
behaviors. Such diagnosis is critical for gaining insights into why so
many defective chips escape existing manufacturing testing. (b)
In-field detection of defective chips. (c) New test experiments to
understand the effectiveness of new techniques for detecting defective
chips. These experiments must overcome the drawbacks and pitfalls of
previous industrial test experiments and case studies.

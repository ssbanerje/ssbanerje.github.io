Hyperscaler reports of silent data corruptions (SDCs), presumed to be caused by silicon
manufacturing defects, have motivated the development of functional tests for detecting defective
CPUs. We present ITHICA, an approach for automatically generating functional tests for
defect-induced errors from arbitrary programs by inserting intra-thread, instruction-level error
checks, primarily leveraging instruction duplication and output comparison. Our key insight is that
the most pernicious defects cause inconsistent errors: two executions of the same instruction within
the same thread, given the same inputs, can produce different architectural outputs depending on the
execution context in which they run. By exploiting this insight, ITHICA enables arbitrary programs
to serve as tests and identifies affected instructions upon error detections. We use ITHICA to
transform industrial hyperscaler test programs (our baseline), datacenter workloads, and common
libraries into functional tests, and evaluate them on over 3,000 CPU servers. ITHICA error checks
detect 39% more defective servers than native checks within the ITHICA tests derived from our
baseline programs, and enable novel findings on defect behavior that challenge conclusions drawn by
prior hyperscaler fleet studies.

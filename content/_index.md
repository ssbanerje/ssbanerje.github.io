I am a PhD candidate in [Computer Science][cs@uiuc] at the [University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign][uiuc], advised by [Ravishankar K. Iyer][rkiyer]. I am affiliated with the
[DEPEND][] research group at the [Coordinated Science Laboratory][csl]. My research aims to improve
the performance, resilience, and ease of management of large-scale heterogeneous computer systems.

I am particularly interested applying machine learning to challenging problems within the design and
management of computer systems. My research has demonstrated the application of domain-knowledge
(i.e., knowledge about software and hardware architecture) as an inductive bias to ML techniques to
solve a variety of systems problems, including heterogeneous resource management, distributed
failure detection, and resilience assessment.

In past summers I have interned at [IBM Research][ibm], [Microsoft Research][msr], and [CERN][].

I am currently a Software Engineer at Google, where I work on the development of reliable hardware
systems for Machine Learning and AI. My work specifically focuses on Tensor Processing Units
(TPUs).

I received a Ph.D. from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign][uiuc], where my
research aimed to improve the performance, resilience, and ease of management of large-scale
heterogeneous computer systems. I was advised by [Ravishankar K. Iyer][rkiyer] and affiliated
with the [DEPEND][] research group at the [Coordinated Science Laboratory][csl].

In past summers I have interned at [IBM Research][ibm], [Microsoft Research][msr], and [CERN][].

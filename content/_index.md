I am a Software Engineer at Google, where I work on building reliable hardware systems for 
machine learning and AI.

I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the
[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign][uiuc], advised by [Ravishankar K. Iyer][rkiyer].
My dissertation research aimed to improve the performance, resilience, and ease of management
of large-scale computer systems using machine learning.
